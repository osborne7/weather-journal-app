# Weather-Journal App Project

# Overview
Create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.  

# Specifics
Create a server and install the Express, Body-Parser, and Cors packages.  Create GET and POST routes that return and add project data.  Acquire API credendials from openweathermap.org.  Make an async GET request to the API to retrieve desired data, then chain a POST request to add desired API data and user data to the app.  Chain another promise that updates the UI dynamically with information for temperature, date, and user input.
